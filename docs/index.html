        <p>
        The biological sciences are becoming more and more data driven. Technological
        advancements have led to a huge increase in the generation of biological data.
        Data analysis, required to extract insights from this data, is often the rate
        limiting step in biological research. This book will help make your data
        analysis more effective.

            If you want to learn how to use the command line to install and run
            software this book is for you. The command line is used throughout
            the book and you will quickly gain familiarity with the most important
            commands. You will also learn how to install software and how to
            work on remote machines. The latter will be important if you want to

            If you want to learn how to write your own data analysis scripts
            this book is also for you. The book starts off by explaining fundamental
            computing concepts, teaching you how to think like a computer.
            You will then learn how to use Python by creating a script to analyse
            the GC-content of a bacterial genome. There is also a chapter on
            data visualisation that teaches you how to work with R. Furthermore,
            programming best practises are highlighted and explained throughout the
            book.

            If you want to ensure that your data analysis is reproducible this book
            is also for you. Early on you will learn how to use version control to
            track changes to your projects. Furthermore, the concept of using
            automation to ensure reproducibility is explored in detail.

        <header><h3>About the author</h3></header>

        <p>
        Tjelvar Olsson did his undergraduate and PhD in biochemistry.
        During his PhD he found himself drifting into computing.
        This process was largely guided by trail and error and was quite
        painful. At the time there were not many resources for helping
        biologists make this transition.
        </p>

        <p>
        After his PhD he wanted to learn more about professional software
        development (and chemistry) and got a job as an application
        scientist at a company that developed software and databases for
        the pharmaceutical industry. During this time he was fortunate
        enough to work with great people and learnt lots about coding,
        programming best practises and software development processes.
        </p>

        <p>
        After six years the lure of biology and academia became too much
        and he got a job as a scientific computing lab manager in a world
        leading plant research institute. In this role he is constantly
        coming into contact with people that are in the same position he
        was in 12 years ago; biologists drifting into computing.
        </p>

        <p>
        This book is his attempt to provide a resource for these biologists
        drifting into computing.
