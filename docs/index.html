      <p>
      The biological sciences are becoming more and more data driven. Technological
      advancements have led to a huge increase in the generation of biological data.
      Data analysis, required to extract insights from this data, is often the rate
      limiting step in biological research. This book will help make your data
      analysis more effective.

      <header><h3>Who is this book for?</h3></header>

       <h4>Biologist's that need to use the command line</h4>
       <p>
        If you want to learn how to use the command line to install and run
        software this book is for you. The command line is used throughout
        the book and you will quickly gain familiarity with the most important
        commands. You will also learn how to install software and how to
        work on remote machines. The latter will be important if you want to
        run bioinformatics software on your institutes high performance cluster.
        </p>

       <h4>Biologists that want to create their own data analysis scripts</h4>
        <p>
        If you want to learn how to write your own data analysis scripts
        this book is also for you. The book starts off by explaining fundamental
        computing concepts, teaching you how to think like a computer.
        You will then learn how to use Python by creating a script to analyse
        the GC-content of a bacterial genome. There is also a chapter on
        data visualisation that teaches you how to work with R. Furthermore,
        programming best practises are highlighted and explained throughout the
        book.
        </p>

        <h4>Biologists that want to ensure their data analysis is reproducible</h4>
        <p>
        If you want to ensure that your data analysis is reproducible this book
        is also for you. Early on you will learn how to use version control to
        track changes to your projects. Furthermore, the concept of using
        automation to ensure reproducibility is explored in detail.
        </p>

        <h4>No prior knowledge required</h4>
        <p>
        Important concepts and jargon are explained as they are introduced.  No
        prior knowledge is required. Just a willingness to learn, experiment
        and have fun geeking out.

      <header><h3>About the author</h3></header>

      <p>
      Tjelvar Olsson did his undergraduate and PhD in biochemistry.
      During his PhD he found himself drifting into computing.
      This process was largely guided by trail and error and was quite
      painful. At the time there were not many resources for helping
      biologist's make this transition.
      </p>

      <p>
      After his PhD he wanted to learn more about professional software
      development (and chemistry) and got a job as an application
      scientist at a company that developed software and databases for
      the pharmaceutical industry. During this time he was fortunate
      enough to work with great people and learnt lots about coding,
      programming best practises and software development processes.
      </p>

      <p>
      After six years the lure of biology and academia became too much
      and he got a job as a scientific computing lab manager in a world
      leading plant research institute. In this role he is constantly
      coming into contact with people that are in the same position he
      was in 12 years ago; biologists drifting into computing.
      </p>

      <p>
      This book is his attempt to provide a resource for these biologists
      drifting into computing.
