Data visualisation
==================


So far we have been learning how to crunch data. Now we will look into
how to visualise it.

There are two main purposes of representing data visually:

1. To explore the data
2. To convey a message to an audience

In this chapter we will look at how both of these can be accomplished using `R
<https://www.r-project.org/>`_ and its associated `ggplot2 <http://ggplot2.org/>`_
package. This choice is based on ggplot2 being one of the best
plotting tools available. It is easy to use and has got sensible defaults that
result in beautiful plots out of the box. An added advantage is that this
gives us a means to get more familiar with R, which is an awesome tool for
statistical computing (although this topic is beyond the scope of this book).
Other tools will be discussed later in the section
:ref:`other-useful-tools-for-scripting-the-generation-of-figures`.
 
We will start off by exploring Fisher's `Iris flower data set
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set>`_. This will be an
exercise in data exploration.

Finally, we will use R and ggplot2 to build up a sliding window plot of the
GC content data from the :doc:`data-analysis` chapter. This will serve to
illustrate some points to consider when trying to convey a message to an
audience.


Starting R and loading the Iris flower data set
-----------------------------------------------

R like Python can be run in an interactive shell. This is a great way to
get familiar with R. To access R's interactive shell simply type ``R`` into your terminal and press enter.

.. code-block:: none

R comes bundled with a number of data sets. To view these you can use the
``data()`` function, which lists all the available data sets.

.. code-block:: R

    > data()
    Data sets in package ‘datasets’:

    AirPassengers           Monthly Airline Passenger Numbers 1949-1960
    BJsales                 Sales Data with Leading Indicator
    BJsales.lead (BJsales)
                            Sales Data with Leading Indicator
    BOD                     Biochemical Oxygen Demand
    CO2                     Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants
    ...

If you want to stop displaying the data sets without having to scroll to the
bottom press the ``q`` button on your keyboard.

We are interested in the Iris flower data set, called ``iris``, let us load
it.

.. code-block:: R

    > data(iris)

This loads the ``iris`` data set into the workspace. You can list the content
of the workspace using the ``ls()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

    > ls()
    [1] "iris"

.. sidebar:: What is a workspace?

    R has the concept of a "workspace". The workspace is the current working
    environment and includes any user defined objects. At the end of a R
    session the user can save the workspace. If saved the workspace will be
    automatically loaded the next time R is started.


Understanding the structure of the ``iris`` data set
----------------------------------------------------

First of all let us find out about the internal structure of the ``iris`` data set using the ``str()`` funciton.

.. code-block:: R

    > str(iris)
    'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:
     $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
     $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
     $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
     $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
     $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

This reveals that the ``iris`` data set is a data frame with 150 observations
and five variables. It is also worth noting that ``Species`` is recorded as
a Factor data structure. This means that it has categorical data. In this case
three different species.

In R a data frame is a data structure for storing two-dimensional data.  In a
data frame each column contains the same type of data and each row has values
for each column.

.. sidebar:: What is the difference between vectors, lists and data frames?

    As well as data frames R also has concepts of vectors and lists.
    A vector is a list where each item is of the same type. A list
    is more flexible in that the items can be of different types.
    The data frame is essentially a list of equal length lists.

You can find the names of the columns in a data frame using the ``names()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

    > names(iris)
    [1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"

To find the number of columns and rows one can use the ``ncol()`` and
``nrow()`` functions, respectively.

.. code-block:: R

    > ncol(iris)
    [1] 5
    > nrow(iris)
    [1] 150

To view the first six rows of a data frame one can use the ``head()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

        > head(iris)
      Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
    1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
    2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
    3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
    4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
    5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
    6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa

To view the last six rows of a data frame one can use the ``tail()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

    > tail(iris)
        Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width   Species
    145          6.7         3.3          5.7         2.5 virginica
    146          6.7         3.0          5.2         2.3 virginica
    147          6.3         2.5          5.0         1.9 virginica
    148          6.5         3.0          5.2         2.0 virginica
    149          6.2         3.4          5.4         2.3 virginica
    150          5.9         3.0          5.1         1.8 virginica


.. warning:: Often the most difficult aspect of data visualisation using R and
             ggplot2 is getting the data into the right structure. The ``iris``
             data set is well structured in the sense that each observation is
             recorded as a separate row and each row has the same number of columns.
             Furthermore, each column in a row has a value, note for example
             how each row has a value indicating the ``Species``.
             Once your data is well structured plotting it becomes relatively
             easy. However, if you are used to adding heterogeneous data to Excel
             the biggest issue that you will face is formatting the data so that
             it becomes well structured and can be loaded as a data frame in R.
             For more detail on how to structure your data see
             :ref:`tidy-data`.


A note on statistics in R
-------------------------

Although this book is not about statistics it is worth mentioning that R is a
superb tool for doing statistics. It has many built in functions for statistical
computing. For example to calculate the median ``Sepal.Length`` for the ``iris``
data one can use the built in ``median()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

    > median(iris$Sepal.Length)
    [1] 5.8

In the above the ``$`` symbol is used to specify the column of interest in the
data frame.

Another useful tool for getting an overview of a data set is the
``summary()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

    > summary(iris)
      Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width
     Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100
     1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300
     Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300
     Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199
     3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800
     Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500
           Species
     setosa    :50
     versicolor:50
     virginica :50


Default plotting in R
---------------------

Before using ggplot2 let us have a look at how to generate default
plots in R.

First of all let us plot a histogram of the ``Sepal.Length``
(:numref:`iris-sepal-length-histogram`).

.. code-block:: R

    > hist(iris$Sepal.Length)

.. _iris-sepal-length-histogram:
.. figure:: images/iris_sepal_length_histogram.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length histogram.

   Histogram of Iris sepal length data generated using R's built in ``hist()``
   function.

Scatter plots can be produced using the ``plot()`` function.
The command below produces a scatter plot of ``Sepal.Width``
versus ``Sepal.Length`` (:numref:`iris-sepal-length-vs-width-scatterplot`).

.. code-block:: R

    > plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)

.. _iris-sepal-length-vs-width-scatterplot:
.. figure:: images/iris_sepal_length_vs_width_scatterplot.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length vs width scatter plot.

   Scatter plot of Iris sepal length vs width generated using R's built in ``plot()``
   function.

Finally, a decent overview of the all data can be obtained by passing the
entire data frame to the ``plot()`` function (:numref:`iris-sepal-data-summary-plot`).

.. code-block:: R

    > plot(iris)

.. _iris-sepal-data-summary-plot:
.. figure:: images/iris_sepal_data_summary_plot.png
   :alt: Iris sepal data summary plot.

   Overview plot of Iris data using R's built in ``plot()`` function.

R's built in plotting functions are useful for getting quick exploratory
views of the data. However, they are a bit dull. In the next section we will
make use of the ggplot2 package to make more visually pleasing and informative
figures.


Installing the ggplot2 package
------------------------------

If you haven't used it before you will need to install the ggplot2 package.
Detailed instructions can be found in :ref:`installing_r_packages`. In summary
you need to run the command below.

.. code-block:: R

    > install.packages("ggplot2")


Loading the ggplot2 package
---------------------------

In order to make use of the ggplot2 package we need to load it. This is achieved
using the ``library()`` function.

.. code-block:: R

    > library("ggplot2")


Plotting using ggplot2
----------------------

To get an idea of what it feels like to work with ggplot2 let us re-create the
previous histogram and scatter plot with it.

Let us start with the histogram (:numref:`ggplot-iris-sepal-length-histogram`).

.. code-block:: R

    > ggplot(data=iris, mapping=aes(Sepal.Length)) + geom_histogram()

.. _ggplot-iris-sepal-length-histogram:
.. figure:: images/ggplot_iris_sepal_length_histogram.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length histogram plotted using ggplot.

   Histogram of Iris sepal length data generated using R's ggplot2 package.
   The default bin width used is different from the one used by R's built in ``hist()``
   function, hence the difference in the appearance of the distribution.

The syntax used may look a little bit strange at first. However, before going
into more details about what it all means let's create the scatter plot
(:numref:`ggplot-iris-sepal-length-vs-width-scatterplot`) to
get a better feeling of how to work with ggplot2.



.. code-block:: R

    > ggplot(data=iris, mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width)) + geom_point()


.. _ggplot-iris-sepal-length-vs-width-scatterplot:
.. figure:: images/ggplot_iris_sepal_length_vs_width_scatterplot.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length vs width scatter plotted using ggplot.

   Scatter plot of Iris sepal length vs width generated using R's ggplot2
   package.

In the examples above we provide the ``ggplot()`` function with two
arguments ``data`` and ``mapping``. The former contains the data frame
of interest and the latter specifies the columns(s) to be plotted.

The ``ggplot`` function returns a ggplot object that can be plotted.  However,
in order to view an actual plot one needs to add a layer to the ggplot object
defining how the data should be presented.  In the examples above this is
achieved using the ``+ geom_histogram()`` and ``+ geom_point()`` syntax.

A ggplot object consists of separate layers. The reason for separating out the
generation of a figure into separate layers is to allow the user to better be
able to reason about the best way to represent the data.

The three layers that we have come across so far are:

- Data: the data to be plotted
- Aesthetic: how the data should be mapped to the aesthetics of the plot
- Geom: what type of plot should be used

Of the above the "aesthetic" layer is the trickiest to get one's head around.
However, take for example the scatter plot, one aesthetic choice that we have
made for that plot is that the ``Sepal.Length`` should be on the x-axis and
the ``Sepal.Width`` should be on the y-axis.

To reinforce this let us augment the scatter plot by sizing the points in the
scatter plot by the ``Petal.Width`` and coloring them by the ``Species``
(:numref:`ggplot-aesthetic-scatter-plot`), all
of which could be considered to be aesthetic aspects of how to plot the data.

.. code-block:: R

    > ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length,
    +                  y=Sepal.Width,
    +                  size=Petal.Width,
    +                  color=Species)) + geom_point()

In the above the secondary prompt, represented by the plus character (``+``),
denotes a continuation line. In other words R interprets the above as one line of code.

.. _ggplot-aesthetic-scatter-plot:
.. figure:: images/ggplot_aesthetic_scatter_plot.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length vs width, ponints sized by petal width coloured by species.

   Scatter plot of Iris sepal length vs width, where the size of each point represents
   the petal width and the colour is used to indicate the species.

The information in the scatterplot is now four dimensional! The x- and y-axis
show ``Sepal.Length`` and ``Sepal.Width``, the size of the point indicates the
``Petal.Width`` and the colour shows the ``Species``.  By adding
``Petal.Width`` and ``Species`` as additional aesthetic attributes to the
figure we can start to discern structure that was previously hidden.


Available "Geoms"
-----------------

The ggplot2 package comes bundled with a wide range of geoms ("geometries" for
plotting data). So far we have seen ``geom_histogram()`` and ``geom_point()``.
To find out what other geoms are available you can start typing ``geom_`` into
a R session and hit the Tab key to list the available geoms using tab-completion.

.. code-block:: R

    > geom_
    geom_abline      geom_errorbarh   geom_quantile
    geom_area        geom_freqpoly    geom_raster
    geom_bar         geom_hex         geom_rect
    geom_bin2d       geom_histogram   geom_ribbon
    geom_blank       geom_hline       geom_rug
    geom_boxplot     geom_jitter      geom_segment
    geom_contour     geom_label       geom_smooth
    geom_count       geom_line        geom_spoke
    geom_crossbar    geom_linerange   geom_step
    geom_curve       geom_map         geom_text
    geom_density     geom_path        geom_tile
    geom_density_2d  geom_point       geom_violin
    geom_density2d   geom_pointrange  geom_vline
    geom_dotplot     geom_polygon
    geom_errorbar    geom_qq

These work largely as expected, for example the ``geom_boxplot()`` results in a
boxplot and the ``geom_line()`` results in a line plot. For illustrations
of these different geoms in action have a look at the
`examples in the ggplot2 documentation <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html>`_.


Scripting data visualisation
----------------------------

Now that we have a basic understanding of how to interact with R and the functionality
in the ggplot library, let's take a step towards automating the figure generation by
recording the steps required to plot the data in a script.

Let us work on the histogram example. In the code below we store the ggplot
object in the variable ``g`` and make use of ``ggsave()`` to write the plot to
a file named ``iris_sepal_length_histogram.png``. Save the code below to a file named
``iris_sepal_length_histogram.R`` using your favorite text editor.

.. code-block:: R

    
    library("ggplot2")
    data(iris)

    g <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(Sepal.Length)) +
         geom_histogram()

    ggsave('iris_sepal_length_histogram.png')

To run this code we make use of the program ``Rscript``, which comes bundled with your
R installation.

.. code-block:: none

    $ Rscript iris_sepal_length_histogram.R

This will write the file ``iris_sepal_length_histogram.png`` to your current working
directory.


Faceting
--------

In the extended scatterplot example (:numref:`ggplot-aesthetic-scatter-plot`)
we found that it was useful to be able to visualise which data points belonged
to which species. Maybe it would be useful to do something similar with the
data in our histogram.

In order to achieve this ggplot2 provides the concept of faceting,
the ability to split your data by one or more variables. Let us split the
data by ``Species`` using the ``facet_grid()`` function
(:numref:`ggplot-faceted-histogram`).

.. code-block:: R

    library("ggplot2")
    data(iris)

    g <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(Sepal.Length)) +
         geom_histogram() +
         facet_grid(Species ~ .)

    ggsave('iris_sepal_length_histogram.png')

In the above the ``facet_grid(Species ~ .)`` states that we want one
``Species`` per row, as opposed to one species per column
(``facet_grid(. ~ Species)``). Replacing the dot (``.``) with another
variable would result in faceting the data into a two dimensional grid.

.. _ggplot-faceted-histogram:
.. figure:: images/ggplot_faceted_histogram.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length histogram faceted by species.

   Histogram of Iris sepal length data faceted by species.

Faceting is a really powerful feature of ggplot2! It allows you to
easily split data based on one or more variables and can result in
insights about underlying structures and multivariate trends.


Adding more colour
------------------

The faceted histogram plot (:numref:`ggplot-faceted-histogram`) clearly
illustrates that there are differences in the distributions of the sepal length
between the different Iris species.

However, suppose that the faceted histogram figure was meant to be displayed
next to the extended scatter plot (:numref:`ggplot-aesthetic-scatter-plot`). To make it easier to make
the mental connection between the two data representations it may be useful
to colour the histograms by species as well.

The colour of a histogram is an aesthetic characteristic. Let us add the
fill colour as an aesthetic to the histogram geometric object
(:numref:`ggplot-faceted-and-coloured-histogram`).

.. code-block:: R

    library("ggplot2")
    data(iris)

    g <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(Sepal.Length)) +
         geom_histogram(aes(fill=Species)) +
         facet_grid(Species ~ .)

    ggsave('iris_sepal_length_histogram.png')


.. _ggplot-faceted-and-coloured-histogram:
.. figure:: images/ggplot_faceted_and_coloured_histogram.png
   :alt: Iris sepal length histogram faceted and coloured by species.

   Histogram of Iris sepal length data faceted and coloured by species.


Purpose of data visualisation
-----------------------------

There are two main purposes of representing data visually:

1. To explore the data
2. To convey a message to an audience

So far we have been focussing on the former. Let us now think a little bit
more about the latter, conveying a message to an audience. In other words
creating figures for presentations and publications.


Conveying a message to an audience
----------------------------------

The first step in creating an informative figure is to consider who the
intended audience is. Is it the general public, school children or
plant biologists? The general public may be interested in trends, whereas
a plant scientist may be interested in a more detailed view.

Secondly, what is the message that you want to convey? Stating this explicitly
will help you when making decisions about the content and the layout of the
figure.

Thirdly, what medium will be used to display the figure? Will it be displayed
for a minute on a projector or will it be printed in an article? The audience
will have less time to absorb details from the former.

So suppose we wanted to create a figure intended for biologists, illustrating
that there is not much variation in the local GC content of *Streptomyces
coelicolor*  A3(2), building on the example in :doc:`data-analysis`. Let us
further suppose that the medium is in a printed journal where the figure can
have a maximum width of 89 mm.

First of all make sure that you are in the ``S.coelicolor-local-GC-content``
directory created in :doc:`data-analysis`.

.. code-block:: none

    $ cd S.coelicolor-local-GC-content

Now create a file named ``local_gc_content_figure.R`` and add the R code below
to it.

.. code-block:: R

    library("ggplot2")

    df = read.csv("local_gc_content.csv", header=T)

    g1 = ggplot(df, aes(x=middle, y=gc_content))
    g2 = g1 + geom_line()

    ggsave("local_gc_content.png", width=89, height=50, units="mm")

The code above loads the data and plots it as a line, resulting in a local GC
content plot. Note also that we specify the width and height of the plot in
millimeters in the ``ggsave()`` function.

Let's try it out.

.. code-block:: none

    $ Rscript local_gc_content_figure.R

It should create a file named ``local_gc_content.png`` containing the image
in :numref:`local-gc-content-1`.

.. _local-gc-content-1:
.. figure:: images/local_gc_content_1.png
   :alt: Initial attempt at plotting local GC content.

   Initial attempt at plotting local GC content.


The scale of the y-axis makes the plot misleading. It looks like there
is a lot of variation in the data. Let's expand the y range to span from 0 to
100 percent (:numref:`local-gc-content-2`).

.. code-block:: R
    :emphasize-lines: 7

    library("ggplot2")

    df = read.csv("local_gc_content.csv", header=T)

    g1 = ggplot(df, aes(x=middle, y=gc_content))
    g2 = g1 + geom_line()
    g3 = g2 + ylim(0, 100)

    ggsave("local_gc_content.png", width=89, height=50, units="mm")


.. _local-gc-content-2:
.. figure:: images/local_gc_content_2.png
   :alt: Local GC content with y-axis scaled corretly.

   Local GC content with y-axis scaled corretly.


At the moment it looks like the line is floating in mid-air. This is because
ggplot adds some padding to the limits. Let's turn this off
(:numref:`local-gc-content-3`).

.. code-block:: R
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    library("ggplot2")

    df = read.csv("local_gc_content.csv", header=T)

    g1 = ggplot(df, aes(x=middle, y=gc_content))
    g2 = g1 + geom_line()
    g3 = g2 + ylim(0, 100)
    g4 = g3 + coord_cartesian(expand=FALSE)

    ggsave("local_gc_content.png", width=89, height=50, units="mm")


.. _local-gc-content-3:
.. figure:: images/local_gc_content_3.png
   :alt: Local GC content without padding.

   Local GC content without padding.


The labels on the x-axis are a bit difficult to read. To make it easier
to understand the content of the x-axis let's scale it to use kilobases
as its units (:numref:`local-gc-content-4`).

.. code-block:: R
    :emphasize-lines: 9

    library("ggplot2")

    df = read.csv("local_gc_content.csv", header=T)

    g1 = ggplot(df, aes(x=middle, y=gc_content))
    g2 = g1 + geom_line()
    g3 = g2 + ylim(0, 100)
    g4 = g3 + coord_cartesian(expand=FALSE)
    g5 = g4 + scale_x_continuous(labels=function(x)x/1000)

    ggsave("local_gc_content.png", width=89, height=50, units="mm")

In the above ``function(x)x/1000`` is a function definition. The function
returns the input (``x``) divided by 1000. In this case the function is
passed anonymously (the function is not given a name) to the ``labels``
argument of the ``scale_x_continuous()`` function.


.. _local-gc-content-4:
.. figure:: images/local_gc_content_4.png
   :alt: Local GC content with kilobases as the x axis units.

   Local GC content with kilobases as the x axis units.


Finally, let us add labels to the x-axis (:numref:`local-gc-content-5`).

.. code-block:: R
    :emphasize-lines: 10

    library("ggplot2")

    df = read.csv("local_gc_content.csv", header=T)

    g1 = ggplot(df, aes(x=middle, y=gc_content))
    g2 = g1 + geom_line()
    g3 = g2 + ylim(0, 100)
    g4 = g3 + coord_cartesian(expand=FALSE)
    g5 = g4 + scale_x_continuous(labels=function(x)x/1000)
    g6 = g5 + xlab("Nucleotide position (KB)") + ylab("GC content (%)")

    ggsave("local_gc_content.png", width=89, height=50, units="mm")


.. _local-gc-content-5:
.. figure:: images/local_gc_content_5.png
   :alt: Local GC content with labelled axis.

   Local GC content with labelled axis.

This is a good point to start tracking the ``local_gc_content_figure.R`` file
in version control, see :doc:`keeping-track-of-your-work` for more details.

.. code-block:: none

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

            local_gc_content.png
            local_gc_content_figure.R

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

So we have two untracked files: the R script and the PNG file the R script
generates. We do not want to track the latter in version control as it can be
generated from the script. Let us therefore update our ``.gitignore`` file.

.. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    Sco.dna
    local_gc_content.csv
    local_gc_content.png

Let's check the status of the Git repository now.

.. code-block:: none

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

            modified:   .gitignore

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

            local_gc_content_figure.R

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Great, let us add the ``local_gc_content_figure.R`` and ``.gitignore`` files
and commit a snapshot.

.. code-block:: none

    $ git add local_gc_content_figure.R .gitignore
    $ git commit -m "Added R script for generating local GC plot"
    [master cba7277] Added R script for generating local GC plot
     2 files changed, 13 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 local_gc_content_figure.R


Writing a caption
-----------------

All figures require a caption to help the audience understand how to interpret
the plot.

In this particular case two particular items stand out as missing from being
able to interpret the plot. First of all what is the source of the DNA, i.e.
where is the data from? Secondly, what was the window and step sizes of the
sliding window analysis?

It would also be appropriate to explicitly state what the message of the plot
is, i.e. that there is not much variation in the local GC content. In this case
we could further substantiate this claim by citing the mean and standard deviation
of the local GC content across the genome.

.. code-block:: R

    > df = read.csv("local_gc_content.csv", header=T)
    > mean(df$gc_content)
    [1] 72.13948
    > sd(df$gc_content)
    [1] 1.050728

Below is the final figure and its caption (:numref:`local-gc-content-6`).
The caption has been added by the tool chain used to build this book, not
by R.

.. _local-gc-content-6:
.. figure:: images/local_gc_content_5.png
   :alt: Local GC content with labelled axis.

   There is little variation in the local GC content of *Streptomyces
   coelicolor* A3(2). Using a window size of 100 KB and a step size of 50 KB
   the local GC content has a mean of 72.1% and a standard deviation of 1.1%.

Other useful tools for scripting the generation of figures
----------------------------------------------------------

There are many different ways of visualising data and generating figures.  A
broad distinction can be made between *ad-hoc* methods, usually using graphical
user interfaces and button clicking, and methods that can be automated, i.e.
methods that can reproduce the figure without human intervention.

One take home message from this chapter is that you should automate the
generation of your figures. This will save you time when you realise that you
need to alter the style of all the figures when submitting a manuscript for
publication. It will also make your research more reproducible.

Apart from R and ggplot2 there are several tools available for automating the
generation of your figures.  In Python there is the `matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org/>`_ package, which is very powerful and it is a great
tool for plotting data generated from Python scripts.  `Gnuplot
<http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_ is a scripting language designed to plot data and
mathematical functions, it is particularly good at depicting three-dimensional
data. 

If you are dealing with graphs, as in evolutionary trees and metabolic pathways,
it is worth having a look at `Graphviz <www.graphviz.org/>`_.

A general purpose tool for manipulating images on the command line is
`ImageMagick <www.imagemagick.org/>`_. It can be used to resize, crop and
transform your images.  It is a great tool for automating your image
manipulation.

If you are wanting to visualise data in web pages it is worth investing some
time looking at the various JavaScript libraries available for data
visualisation. One poplar option is `D3.js <https://d3js.org/>`_.


Key concepts
------------

- R and ggplot2 are powerful tools for visualising data
- R should also be your first port of call for statistical computing
  (statistical computing is not covered in this book)
- In ggplot2 the visual representation of your data is built up using layers
- Separating out different aspects of plotting into different layers makes
  it easier to reason about the data and the best way to represent it visually
- Faceting allows you to separate out data on one or more variables, this is
  one of the strengths of ggplot2
- Scripting your data visualisation makes it easier to modify later on
- Scripting your data visualisation makes it reproducible
- When creating a figure ask yourself: who is the audience and what is the message
