Getting some motivation
=======================

Why you should care about computing and coding
----------------------------------------------

Computers can be powerful allies. The are ideal for automating repetitive tasks.
Furthermore, they can perform calculations and analysis that would be infeasible
for the human brain alone.

These days many parts of the biological sciences are becoming more and more data
driven. Technological advancements have led to a huge increase in the
generation of biological data. Data analysis is required to extract biological
insights from this data. To a large extent the rate limiting factor in
generating insight is the lack of appropriate data analysis tools.

However, as an experimental biologist you may prefer to work in the lab over
sitting in front of the computer. You may even ask yourself if learning to
program has any benefit to you whatsoever.

Similar to learning a new language there are several benefits to learning
computer programming. Importantly it gives you a new perspective. In fact
professional programmers are encouraged to learn a new programming language
every year to allow them to experience new problem solving techniques.

More concretely, learning to program will help you get a better understanding
of data analysis. It may even expand your mind to allow you to see new
possibilities available to you.

Furthermore, by getting more familiar with computing your interactions with programmers
and data analysis folk will improve. So even if you never end up writing a
script by yourself learning to code will help you express your ideas to people
that enjoy programming.


What you can expect to learn here
---------------------------------

Many books on computing assume that the reader has a basic knowledge of how a
computer operates and the associated jargon. This booklet attempts not to make any
such assumptions and important concepts are explained in
:doc:`how-to-think-like-a-computer`. Furthermore, important terms and their
background are explained throughout in attempt to demystify computing jargon.
This should stand you in good stead when faced with more advanced material on
computing.

Use of the command line is required for many bioinformatics tools and access to
high-performance computing clusters. The essence of the Unix command line, used
in both Linux and Macs, is introduced in :doc:`first-steps-towards-automation`.
After which the command line is used persistently to interact with a variety of
useful programs. At the end you should feel comfortable using the command line
to interact with your computer and to automate tasks.

Data forms a central part of the biological sciences. However, dealing with
large volumes of data can feel overwhelming. One way to regain some control is
to ensure that there is structure to the data. In
:doc:`structuring-and-storing-data` important data structures and file formats
for representing them are discussed. The chapter also highlights the value of
using plain text files to store data. After reading this chapter you should have
a good idea of how you can store structured representations of your data as
plain text files.

Sooner or later when working on a project one wishes that one had done a better
job of keeping records of one's work. What changes were made when? What
where the reasons behind the decisions to make those changes? This issue
becomes even more accentuated when working on scripts and programs where
tiny changes can have devastating effects. Because this is such an important
issue in software development there are great tools for mitigating against it.
In :doc:`keeping-track-of-your-work` the concept of version control is
introduced using a popular open source tool called Git. After working through
the examples in this chapter you should feel comfortable using Git to keep
track of your work.

When tackling more complex data analysis one needs to spend more time
thinking about the problem up front. In the :doc:`data-munching` chapter we
will look at techniques for breaking problems into smaller and more
manageable chunks. The chapter also introduced the Python scripting language,
string manipulation and regular expressions.
