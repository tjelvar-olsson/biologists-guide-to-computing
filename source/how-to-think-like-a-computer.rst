How to think like a computer
============================

These days computers can perform complex task. However, at their core computers
only have a relatively small set of basic capabilities. Information is stored as
zeros and ones and Boolean logic is used to perform calculations.

This chapter will cover fundamental aspects of computing required to learn
scripting and programming. It will introduce bits and bytes and how they can be
used to represent numbers and characters (as in letters and symbols). The
chapter will also give a brief overview of how a computer stores information
and performs calculations.


Binary, bits and bytes
----------------------

In computing a bit is the smallest unit of information and it can be either
zero or one. Suppose that we wanted to represent a positive integer using
zeros and ones. We can achieve this using using the base-2 numeral systems,
a.k.a. binary.

.. sidebar:: Integer

   An integer is a whole number, i.e. a number that can be expressed without a
   fractional component. In computing people often make a distinction between
   signed and unsigned integers. The former includes negative values and the
   latter does not.


Take for example the number 108. This number can be represented as two sets
of hundreds and eight sets of ones (as well as zero sets of tens).

.. math::

    108 &= 100 + 0 + 8 \\
        &= (1*100) + (0 * 10) + (8 * 1) \\
        &= (1 * 10^2) + (0 * 10^1) + (8 * 10^0)

The equations above illustrate the basis of the base-10 numeral system. Note
that the base of the exponent in each term is ten. This means that one needs
ten states to represent numbers. However, computers only have two states 0 and
1. To express an integer in binary we therefore need to formulate it so that
the base of each exponent is 2.

.. math::

    108 &= 64 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 \\
        &=  (1*64) + (1*32) + (0*16) + (1*8) + (1*4) + (0*2) + (0*1)  \\
        &=  (1 * 2^6) + (1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0)

.. sidebar:: Bit

    In computing the term "Bit" is an abbreviation of the term "Binary digIT".

So to express 108 as binary we could use the bits ``1101100``.

.. table:: Representing the integer 108 in binary.

    == == == = = = =
    64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    == == == = = = =
    1  1  0  1 1 0 0
    == == == = = = =

In computing bits are often grouped together and the most common grouping is to
bundle 8-bits together, this is known as a byte. One byte can therefore have
256 unique states. An unsigned 8-bit integer, stored in a byte, can therefore
represent any integer ranging from 0 to 255.

To recap, in computing a bit is the smallest unit of information and it can be
either zero or one, and a byte is eight bits grouped together. Using several
bits we can express integers using the binary numeral system.

Character encodings
-------------------

If a computer only works in terms of zeros and ones how can one use it to read
and write text? This is the subject of character encodings.

One of the most prevalent character encodings is ASCII (American Standard Code
for Information Interchange), which was first published in 1963. It has its roots in
telegraphic codes. Based on the English alphabet it encodes 128 characters
into 7-bit integers (:numref:`ASCII_Code_Chart-Quick_ref_card`). These
characters include: 0-9, a-z, A-Z, the space character, punctuation symbols and
control codes for operating Teletype machines.

Although many of the control characters are now obsolete some of them still form
the basis of how we interpret text in computers. For example the "line feed" character,
which originally moved the paper in the printer forward, is now used to
represent new lines in text documents.

In going from Teletype machines to computers different operating systems had
different interpretations on how new lines should be represented. One surviving
convention, still in use in Windows, requires both the "line feed" and the
"carriage return" characters. The former representing the advancement of paper
in the printer and the latter the repositioning of the print-head. Another
convention, used in Unix-like systems, is to simply use the line feed
character to represent new lines. This can result in compatibility issues when
opening Unix-like text files in some Windows programs. For example when one
opens a multi-line file with Unix-based line endings in Notepad the text appears
like one long line.

Many other character encodings are based on ASCII. A famous example is
ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), which uses an eighth bit to expand the ASCII character set
to include the remaining characters from the Latin script.

These days the emergent standard is Unicode, which provides a standard encoding
for dealing with most of the worlds writing systems. Unicode is backwards compatible
with ASCII and ISO-8859-1 in that Unicode's code points, the natural numbers used to
assign unique characters, have the same values as those of the ASCII and
ISO-8859-1 encodings.

.. sidebar:: Natural number

   A natural number is a whole non-negative number. In computing such a number
   is commonly referred to as an unsigned integer.

So in computers "text" is really just a convention that maps integers to
characters, or more formally a character encoding.


Real numbers
------------

So we have learnt that integers can be represented in computers with zeros and
ones by making use of the binary numeral system. Let us now discuss how real
numbers can be represented and some issues that one can come across when working
with these.

.. sidebar:: Real numbers

   Real numbers include rational numbers such as integers and fractions as well
   as irrational numbers such as the :math:`\sqrt{2}` and :math:`\pi`.

One way of storing and working with real numbers is to use the fixed-point number
representation. A fixed-point number is basically an integer that is scaled by an
implicit factor. So if the implicit scaling factor was :math:`1/10` and the
explicit integer was :math:`127` then the real number represented would be
:math:`12.7`.

The fixed-point number representation has the disadvantage that the range of
numbers that can be represented is relatively small. Consider an unsigned 8-bit
integer. It can represent the range :math:`0` to :math:`255`. With an implicit
scaling factor of :math:`1/10` it can represent the numbers :math:`0.0` to
:math:`25.5` with a step size of :math:`0.1`. With an implicit scaling factor
of :math:`1/100` it could represent the numbers :math:`0.00` to :math:`2.55`
with a step size of :math:`0.01`.

The floating-point number was invented to work around the inherent small range
limitation of fixed-point number representations.  Floating-point numbers
basically allow the decimal (radix) point to float.  This means that numbers of
differing orders of magnitude can be expressed using the same units. It is
similar to scientific notation where the distance to the moon can be
expressed as :math:`3.844 * 10^8` and the size of a typical bacterium can be
expressed as :math:`1.0 * 10^{-6}`. A consequence of this is that the numbers
that can be expressed are not uniformly spaced, i.e. as the size of the
exponent increases the step size between two representable numbers increases.

.. sidebar:: Floating point number

    Floating point is a means to represent real numbers. The term refers to the
    fact that the radix point of the number is allowed to "float" relative to
    the significant digits of the number. For example the numbers
    :math:`12.7^{-10}`, :math:`12.7` and :math:`12.7^7` could all be expressed
    by floating the radix point around the significant digits :math:`127`.

Not all numbers can be represented precisely using floating-point numbers.
Furthermore, arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers cannot truly
represent arithmetic operations. This can lead to issues with accuracy. We can
illustrate this using Python (we will get more details on scripting and Python
in the :doc:`data-analysis` chapter).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> 0.6 / 0.2
    2.9999999999999996

In the above a rounding error of :math:`4 * 10^{-16}` has been introduced as
a consequence of working with floating point representations of numbers.


Boolean logic
-------------

Boolean logic is a mathematical formalism for describing logical relations.
In Boolean logic things are either ``True`` or ``False``. These truth values
are often represented as 1 and 0 respectively.
There are three basic operators ``AND``, ``OR`` and ``NOT`` for working with
truth values. These are sometimes referred to as logic gates.

=====  =====  ===========  ==========
``x``  ``y``  ``x AND y``  ``x OR y``
=====  =====  ===========  ==========
  0      0         0           0
  1      0         0           1
  0      1         0           1
  1      1         1           1
=====  =====  ===========  ==========

=====  =========
``x``  ``NOT x``
=====  =========
  0        1
  1        0
=====  =========

Using these axioms more complex logic gates can be built up. For example, by
combining ``NOT`` and ``AND`` one can create what is commonly referred to as
a ``NAND`` gate.

=====  =====  ===========  =================
``x``  ``y``  ``x AND y``  ``NOT (x AND y)``
=====  =====  ===========  =================
  0      0         0           1
  1      0         0           1
  0      1         0           1
  1      1         1           0
=====  =====  ===========  =================

Importantly one can use Boolean logic gates to implement integer arithmetic
and memory. This combined with the fact that it is relatively easy to
physically implement Boolean logic using relays led to the construction of
the first computers.

Although you may not want to create your own computer, having a basic
understanding of Boolean logic will help you when implementing algorithms. For
example one often needs to make conditional logic statements along the lines of
"``IF`` the cell contains green fluorescent protein ``AND`` it is illuminated
with light of wavelength 395 nm ``THEN`` it will emit fluorescence at 509 nm".

.. note:: Boolean logic is also used in Boolean networks, a formalism that can
          be used to describe gene regulatory networks at the protein
          expression level, i.e.  mRNA and protein concentrations are not
          considered. The expression level of each gene is considered to be
          either on or off, a.k.a.  1 or 0. The :term:`state` of the model is
          the set of Boolean values used to describe the gene network
          transcription levels at that point in time. Inhibition and activation are
          modeled by creating Boolean rules, which can be further combined using
          Boolean logic. By iteratively applying the Boolean rules the dynamics
          of the system can be evaluated over time. As time progresses the
          number of states of the network decreases as the system is driven
          towards a relatively small number of dynamic cycles and stable
          states, known as attractors. The attractors often correspond to
          specific differentiated states of cells in biological systems.




The microprocessor
------------------

A microprocessor executes machine instructions. Machine instructions tell the
microprocessor what to do.  At the most basic level there are three things that
a microprocessor can do: perform mathematical operations, move data from one
memory location to another, make decisions and jump to new sets of instructions
based on those decisions.

.. sidebar:: The C programming language

   C is a popular programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
   It is a low-level language, which means that it allows the programmer to
   work close to the hardware by providing direct access to the system's memory.
   One of the most famous C projects is the Linux kernel, which is a massive open
   source project with millions of lines of code and thousands of contributors.

Most programming languages provide some sort of abstraction layer so that the
programmer does not need to think in terms of machine instructions. For example,
the main purpose of a C compiler is to convert C source code into machine
instructions.

When working with higher level languages, such as Python, one does not really need
to worry about what happens at the microprocessor level.

However, knowing that a microprocessor can make decisions and jump to new sets
of instructions can be useful when trying to understand concepts such as
loops. A loop is essentially a set of machine instructions that end with a
decision to jump back to the beginning of the same set of instructions.

Loops often include a condition for exiting the loop. If the condition for
exiting the loop is not defined, or it cannot be reached, the loop will keep
cycling forever in what is termed an "infinite loop".

Below is a basic C program illustrating a while loop. The loop terminates when
the integer ``i`` is no longer less than 3.

.. code-block:: C
   :linenos:

   int main () {
      int i = 0;
      while( i < 3 ) {
         i = i + 1;
      }
      return 0;
   }

In more detail, the lines 1 and 7 define a small set of code that forms the
*main* part of the program. Line 2 defines an integer, ``i``, and sets it equal
to 0. Lines 3 and 5 define a *while loop* to iterate as long as ``i`` is less
than 3. Line 4 executes a command to change the value of ``i``. Line 6 states
that the main program should return an exit status 0.

.. sidebar:: What the exit status of a program?

    The exit status of a program is a means for the program to state if it
    was terminated normally or abnormally. The exit status :math:`0` means that the
    program ended normally. Any other exit status means that the program
    was terminated abnormally.



Computer memory
---------------

Computer memory comes in different forms with different characteristics. The
hard drive of a computer is a type of memory where data can be stored
permanently. RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of memory where data is
volatile, i.e. it is not retained when the machine reboots. A less well known
type of memory is the registry, which resides in the CPU (Central Processing
Unit). Being physically close to the CPU means that reading and writing of data
to the registry is very fast. Other important characteristics of computer
memory include the its size and cost. Below is a table summarising these
characteristics.

=========  =========  ==============  ==============  ========
Location   Speed      Size            Cost            Volatile
=========  =========  ==============  ==============  ========
Registry   Very fast  Very small      Very expensive  Yes
RAM        Fast       Small/Moderate  Expensive       Yes
Hard disk  Slow       Very large      Cheap           No
=========  =========  ==============  ==============  ========

One could liken these types of storage to different cooling devices in the lab.
The minus 80 freezer is large and represents a way to store DNA plasmids and
primers persistently. When preparing for a cloning experiment one may get
samples of plasmids and primers and store them in the fridge in the lab for
easy access. However, although the lab fridge provides easy access it does not
present a permanent storage solution. Finally, when performing the cloning
experiment one takes the samples out of the fridge and places them in an
ice-bucket. The ice-bucket is a "working storage" solution to which one can
have very fast access.  In the example above the minus 80 freezer represents
the hard disk, the lab fridge represents RAM and the ice bucket represents the
registry.

If one is working with really large data sets the main bottleneck in the
processing pipeline can be reading data from and writing data to memory.
This is known as being :term:`I/O` (input/output) bound.
