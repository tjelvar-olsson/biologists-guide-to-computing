Apply what you have learnt
--------------------------

The only way to learn is to keep practising. Try to think about how to apply
what you have been learning. You will run into problems, working your way
through these problems is the only way to solidify your knowledge.

Think about your day-to-day work and your research. How could they be improved
by scripting and computing? Try to solve problems that are outside of your
comfort zone. This is how you will extend your expertise.


Be social
---------

Find friends and colleges that are in the same boat as you and talk to them
about your computing experiences and the problems that you are trying to solve.
It is much more fun to learn together and you will keep each other motivated.

Find someone more experienced than you and learn from them. Having a mentor
to point you in the right direction can be a great time saver.

Peter Norvig's essay
`Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years <http://norvig.com/21-days.html>`_
is really interesting. Norvig is the director of research at Google and really
knows what he is talking about. The essay should help you put your learning
into perspective and motivate you when things get tough.

Scott Granneman's
`Linux Phrasebook <http://www.granneman.com/writing/books/linux-phrasebook/>`_
provides a concise reference for learning the foundations of the most important
Unix command line tools.

Scott Chacon and Ben Straub's
`Pro Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_ book provides a comprehensive guide
to Git. I would recommend that you read chapter two of this book to solidify
your understanding of Git. Many of the other chapters in this book are also
really valuable, in particular chapters three and five.

Mark Pilgrim's `Dive Into Python 3 <http://www.diveintopython3.net/>`_ is a great
book for learning the ins and outs of the Python programming language. Note that
this is a new and improved version of
`Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`_. I recommend that you read
Dive Into Python 3 as it is more recent and will teach you about the latest and
greatest version of Python.
