You've got to the end! Well done! Have a cup of tea and a biscuit.

This book has covered a lot of ground to give you a broad understanding of
computing and practises to make your life easier. I hope it will stand you in
good stead in the future.

This chapters gives some suggestions on how to continue exploring.


Apply what you have learnt
--------------------------

The only way to learn is to keep practising. Try to think about how to apply
what you have been learning. You will run into problems, working your way
through these problems is a great way to solidify your knowledge.

Think about your day-to-day work and your research. How could they be improved
by scripting and computing? Try to solve problems that are outside of your
comfort zone. This way you will extend your expertise.


Be social
---------

Find friends and colleges that are in the same boat as you and talk to them
about your computing experiences and the problems that you are trying to solve.
It is much more fun to learn together and you will keep each other motivated.

Find someone more experienced than you and learn from them. Having a mentor
to point you in the right direction can be a great time saver.

Peter Norvig's essay
`Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years <http://norvig.com/21-days.html>`_
is really interesting. Norvig is the director of research at Google and really
knows what he is talking about. The essay should help you put your learning
into perspective and motivate you when things get tough.

Scott Granneman's
`Linux Phrasebook <http://www.granneman.com/writing/books/linux-phrasebook/>`_
provides a concise reference for learning the foundations of the most important
Unix command line tools.

Hadley Wickaham's article
`Tidy Data <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>`_
describes the concept of "Tidy Data" in detail along with background,
motivation and case studies. It is an accessible read and will give you the
tools required to structure your data so that it can be visualised directly
by ggplot2.

Scott Chacon and Ben Straub's
`Pro Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_ book provides a comprehensive guide
to Git. I would recommend that you read chapter two of this book to solidify
your understanding of Git. Many of the other chapters in this book are also
really valuable, in particular chapters three and five.

John D. Blischak , Emily R. Davenport, Greg Wilson's article
"A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub" is aimed at
scientists wanting to start using version control. It has some great
figures for explaining how Git works visually.
DOI: `10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668>`_

Mark Pilgrim's `Dive Into Python 3 <http://www.diveintopython3.net/>`_ is a great
book for learning the ins and outs of the Python programming language. Note that
this is a new and improved version of
`Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`_. I recommend that you read
Dive Into Python 3 as it is more recent and will teach you about the latest and
greatest version of Python.

Zed A. Shaw's `Learning Python the Hard Way <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_
is another great book for learning Python. The book uses what Shaw refers to
as
`Educational Mithridatism <https://zedshaw.com/2015/09/14/educational-mithridatism/>`_,
where the use of repetition is applied to help you learn quicker.

Nicolas P. Rougier, Michael Droettboom, Philip E. Bourne's article
"Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures" is a great resource of practical
advice to help you create better scientific illustrations.
DOI: `10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833>`_

Geir Kjetil Sandve , Anton Nekrutenko, James Taylor, Eivind Hovig's article
"Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research" provides advice on how
you can make your research more easily reproducible.
DOI: `10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285>`_

Greg Wilson, Jennifer Bryan, Karen Cranston, Justin Kitzes, Lex
Nederbragt, Tracy K. Teal's article
`Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037>`_
provides a well informed and opinionated view of tools and practises that
people performing scientific computing should adopt.

Andrew Hunt and David Thomas'
`The Pragmatic Programmer <https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer>`_
is a modern classic on software development. This book will teach you programming
best practices.

computing point of view.
