Practical problem solving
=========================

So far we have been learning about computing and coding.

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce some practical techniques for
tackling data analysis problems.

At this point we go back to looking at the Swiss-Prot FASTA file used in
:doc:`first-steps-towards-automation`. You can download this file using
the ``curl`` command below.

.. code-block:: none

    $ curl --location --output uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz http://bit.ly/1l6SAKb

The downloaded ``uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz`` file is gzipped. You can view the
content of this file without permanently unzipping it using the command below.

.. code-block:: none

    $ gunzip -c uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz

If the ``curl`` and ``gunzip`` commands above look unfamiliar you may want to
review the :doc:`first-steps-towards-automation` chapter.

By briefly inspecting some random FASTA description lines it becomes clear that
some species include variants. Below are some sample *E. coli* extracts from
the FASTA file.

.. code-block:: none

    ...IraP OS=Escherichia coli (strain SE11) GN=iraP PE=3 SV=1
    ...IraP OS=Escherichia coli (strain SMS-3-5 / SECEC) GN=iraP PE=3 SV=1
    ...IraP OS=Escherichia coli (strain UTI89 / UPEC) GN=iraP PE=3 SV=1

How many variants are there per species? Do all variants contain the same
number of proteins?

To answer these questions we will make use of the Python scripting language
and some practical problem solving techniques.


Stop and think
--------------

One of the most common mistakes when programming is to start coding before the
problem is clearly defined.

What do we want to achieve? Pause for a second and try to answer this question
to yourself. It may help trying to explain it out loud.

.. sidebar:: Rubber duck debugging

    When faced with a tricky :term:`bug` many programmers find that one of
    the best methods to :term:`debug` their code is to explain it to a
    colleague. The act of verbalising ones assumptions often identifies the
    problem at hand without the colleague having to do anything except listen.
    This technique is so powerful that some programmers use a rubber duck,
    as a substitute for a colleague, when the latter is unavailable. This method
    is not limited to debugging, hence the suggestion to verbalise the problem
    statement out loud.

Now describe all the steps required to achieve this goal. Again it may help
speaking out loud to yourself or imagining that you are describing the required
steps to a colleague.

Did you find that easy or difficult? Thinking about what one wants to achieve
and all the steps required to get there can often be quite overwhelming.
When this happens it is easy to think to oneself that the detail will become clear
later on and that one should stop wasting time and get on with the coding. Try
to avoid doing this. Rather, try to think of a simpler goal. 

For example consider the goal of working out how many different species there
are in the FASTA file. This goal would require us to:

1. Identify all the description lines in the FASTA file
2. Extract the organism name from the line
3. Ensure that there are no duplicate entries
4. Count the number of entries

If you know the tools and techniques required to do all of the steps above this
may not seem overwhelming. However, if you don't it will. In either case it is
worthwhile to treat each step as a goal in itself and work out the sub-steps
required to achieve these. By iterating over this process you
will either get down to steps sizes that do not feel overwhelming or you will
identify the key aspect that you feel unsure about.

For example, the first step to identify all the description lines in the
FASTA file can be decomposed into the sub-steps below.

1. Create a list for storing the description lines
2. Iterate over all the lines in the input file
3. For each line check if it is a description line
4. If it is add the line to the list

Now suppose one felt unsure about how to check if a line was a description
line. This would represent a good place to start experimenting with some actual
code. Can we come up with a code snippet that can check if a string is a FASTA
description line?


Measuring success
-----------------

Up until this point we have been testing our code snippets by running the code
and verifying the results manually. This is terribly inefficient and soon breaks
down once you have more than one thing to test.

It is much better to write tests that can be run automatically.  Let's examine
this concept. Create a file named ``fasta_utils.py`` and add the Python
code below to it.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def test_is_description_line():
        """Test the is_description_line() function."""
        print("Testing the is_description_line() function...")

    test_is_description_line()

The first line is a module level "docstring" and it is used to explain the
intent of the module as a whole.  A "module" is basically a file with a ``.py``
extension, i.e. a Python file. Modules are used to group related functionality
together.

Lines three to five represent a function named :func:`test_is_description_line`.
Python functions consist of two parts: the function definition (line 3) and the
function body (lines 4 and 5). 

In Python functions are defined using the ``def`` keyword. Note that the
``def`` keyword is followed by the name of the function. The name of the
function is followed by a parenthesized set of arguments, in this case the
function takes no arguments. The end of the function definition is marked using
a colon.

The body of the function, lines four and five, need to be indented. The standard
in Python is to use four white spaces to indent code blocks.

.. warning:: Whitespace really matters in Python! If your code is not correctly
             aligned you will see ``IndentationError`` messages telling you
             that everything is not as it should be. You will also run into
             ``IndentationError`` messages if you mix white spaces and tabs.

The first line of the function body, line four, is a docstring explaining the
intent of the function.  Line five makes use of the built-in ``print()``
function to write a string to the :term:`standard output stream`. Python's built-in
``print()`` function is similar to the ``echo`` command we used earlier in
:doc:`keeping-track-of-your-work`.

Finally, on line seven the :func:`test_is_description_line` function is called,
i.e. the logic within the function's body is executed. In this instance this
means that the ``"Testing the is_description_line() function..."`` string is
written to the standard output stream.

Let us run this script in a terminal. To run a Python script we use the ``python``
command followed by the name of the script.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...

So far so good? At the moment our :func:`test_is_description_line` function
does not actually test anything. Let us rectify that now.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def test_is_description_line():
        """Test the is_description_line() function."""
        print("Testing the is_description_line() function...")
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True

    test_is_description_line()

There are quite a few things going on in the newly added line. First of all it
makes use of three built-in features of Python: the ``assert`` and ``is``
keywords, as well as the ``True`` constant. Let's work through these in reverse
order.

Python has some `built-in constants
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/constants.html>`_, most notably ``True``,
``False`` and ``None``. The ``True`` and ``False`` constants are the only
instances of the ``bool`` (boolean) type and ``None`` is often used to
represent the absence of a value.

In Python ``is`` is an operator that checks for object identity, i.e. if the
object returned by the :func:`is_description_line` function and ``True`` are
the same object. If they are the same object the comparison evaluates to
``True`` if not it evaluates to ``False``.

The ``assert`` keyword is used to insert debugging statements into a program.
It provides a means to ensure that the state of a program is as expected. If
the statement evaluates to ``False`` an ``AssertionError`` is raised.

So, what will happen if we run the code in its current form?
Well, we have not yet defined the :func:`is_description_line` function, so
Python will raise a ``NameError``. Let us run the code.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 8, in <module>
        test_is_description_line()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 6, in test_is_description_line
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True
    NameError: global name 'is_description_line' is not defined

Great now we are getting somewhere! What? Well, we have impemented some
code to test the functionality of the :func:`is_description_line` and it
tells us that the function does not exist. This is useful information.
Let us add a placeholder :func:`is_description_line` function to the Python
module.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3,4

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def is_description_line(line):
        """Return True if the line is a FASTA description line."""

    def test_is_description_line():
        """Test the is_description_line() function."""
        print("Testing the is_description_line() function...")
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True

    test_is_description_line()

Note that the function we have added on lines three and four currently does nothing.
By default the function will return ``None``.  However, when we run the script
we should no longer get a ``NameError``. Let's find out what happens when we
run the code.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 11, in <module>
        test_is_description_line()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 9, in test_is_description_line
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True
    AssertionError

More progress! Now we see the expected ``AssertionError``, becuase ``None`` is
not ``True``. Let us add some code to try to get rid of this error message. To
achieve this we simply need to make the function return ``True``.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def is_description_line(line):
        """Return True if the line is a FASTA description line."""
        return True

    def test_is_description_line():
        """Test the is_description_line() function."""
        print("Testing the is_description_line() function...")
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True

    test_is_description_line()

Now, we can run the code again.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...

No error message, the code is now working to the specification described in the test.
However, the test does not specify what the behaviour should be for a biological
sequence line. Let us add another assert statement to specify this.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 11

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def is_description_line(line):
        """Return True if the line is a FASTA description line."""
        return True

    def test_is_description_line():
        """Test the is_description_line() function."""
        print("Testing the is_description_line() function...")
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True
        assert is_description_line("ATCG") is False

    test_is_description_line()

Now we can run the code again.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 13, in <module>
        test_is_description_line()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 11, in test_is_description_line
        assert is_description_line("ATCG") is False
    AssertionError

More progress, we now have a test to ensure that the :func:`is_description_line` function
returns ``False`` when the input line is a sequence. Let us try to implement the desired
functionality to make the test pass. For this we will use the
`startswith() <https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith>`_ method,
that is built into strings, to check if the string starts with a greater than (``>``) character.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def is_description_line(line):
        """Return True if the line is a FASTA description line."""
        if line.startswith(">"):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def test_is_description_line():
        """Test the is_description_line() function."""
        print("Testing the is_description_line() function...")
        assert is_description_line(">This is a description line") is True
        assert is_description_line("ATCG") is False

    test_is_description_line()

In the code above we make use of conditional logic, i.e. ``if`` something is
``True`` the code does something otherwise it does something ``else``. As mentioned previously
whitespace is important in Python and four spaces are used to indent the lines after
the ``if`` and ``else`` statements to tell Python which statement(s) belong in the conditional
code blocks. In this case we only have one statement per conditional, but it is
possible to group several statements together based on their indentation.

Let us test the code again.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...


Fantastic the code behaves in the way that we want it to behave!

However, the current implementation of the :func:`is_description_line` function
is a little bit verbose. Do we really need the ``else`` conditional?  What
would happen if it was not there?

The beauty of tests now become more apparent. We can start experimenting with
the implementation of a function and feel confident that we are not breaking
it. As long as the tests do not fail that is!

Let us test out our hypothesis that the ``else`` conditional is redundant by
removing it and de-denting the ``return False`` statement.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 7

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    def is_description_line(line):
        """Return True if the line is a FASTA description line."""
        if line.startswith(">"):
            return True
        return False

Now we can simply run the tests to see what happens.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...

Amazing, we just made a change to our code and we can feel pretty sure that it is
still working as intended. This is very powerful. Incidentally, the code works
by virtue of the fact that if the ``return True`` statement is reached the function
returns ``True`` and exits, as such the second ``return`` statement is not called.

The methodology used in this section is known as Test-Driven Development, often
referred to as TDD. It involves three steps:

1. Write a test
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code if necessary

In this instance we started off by writing a test checking that the
:func:`is_description_line` function returned ``True`` when the input was a
description line.  We then added *minimal* code to make the test pass, i.e.  we
simply made the function return ``True``. At this point no refactoring was
needed so we added another test to check that the function returned ``False``
when the input was a sequence line. We then added some naive code to make the
tests pass.  At this point, we believed that there was scope to improve the
implementation of the function, so we refactored it to remove the redundant
``else`` statement.

Well done! That was a lot of information. Go make yourself a cup of tea.


More string processing
----------------------

Because information about DNA and proteins are often stored in plain text files
many aspects of biological data processing involves manipulating text. In
computing text is often referred to as strings of characters. String
manipulation is is therefore a common task both for processing biological
sequences and for interpreting sequence identifiers.

This section will provide a brief summary of how Python can be used for
such string processing.

Start Python in its interactive mode by typing ``python`` into the terminal.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python
    Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.39)] on darwin

The Python string object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When parsing in strings from a text file one often has to deal with lines that
have leading and/or trailing white spaces. Commonly one wants to get rid of them.
This can be achieved using the ``strip()`` method built into the string object.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "  text with leading/trailing spaces ".strip()
    'text with leading/trailing spaces'

Another common use case is to replace a word in a line. For example,
when we strip out the leading and trailing white spaces one might want to
update the word "with" to "without" to make the resulting string reflect
its current state. This can be achieved using the ``replace()`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "  text with leading/trailing spaces ".strip().replace("with", "without")
    'text without leading/trailing spaces'

.. note:: In the example above we chain the ``strip()`` and ``replace()`` methods
          together. In practise this means that the ``replace()`` methods acts
          on the return value of the ``strip()`` method.

.. sidebar:: What is the difference between a function and a method?

             Often the two terms are used interchangeably. However, a method refers
             to a function that is part of a class and the term function refers to
             a function which stands on its own.

Earlier we saw how the ``startswith()`` method can be used to identify FASTA
description lines.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ">MySeq1|description line".startswith(">")
    True

The ``endswith()`` method complements the ``startswith()`` method and is often
used to examine file extensions.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "/home/olsson/images/profile.png".endswith("png")
    True

This example above only works if the file extension is in lower case.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "/home/olsson/images/profile.PNG".endswith("png")
    False

However, we can overcome this issue by adding a call to the ``lower()`` method,
which converts the string to lower case.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "/home/olsson/images/profile.PNG".lower().endswith("png")
    True

Another common use case is to search for a particular string within
another string. For example one might want to find out if the UniProt
identifier "Q6GZX4" is present in a FASTA description line. To achieve this one
can use the ``find()`` method, which returns the index position (zero-based)
where the search term was first identified.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ">sp|Q6GZX4|001R_FRG3G".find("Q6GZX4")
    4

If the search term is not identified ``find()`` returns -1.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ">sp|P31946|1433B_HUMAN".find("Q6GZX4")
    -1

When iterating over lines in a file one often wants to split the line based on a
delimiter. This can be achieved using the ``split()`` method. By default this
splits on white space characters and returns a list of strings.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "text without leading/trailing spaces".split()
    ['text', 'without', 'leading/trailing', 'spaces']

A different delimiter can be used by providing it as an argument to the ``split()``
method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ">sp|Q6GZX4|001R_FRG3G".split("|")
    ['>sp', 'Q6GZX4', '001R_FRG3G']

There are many variations on the string operators described above. It is useful
to familiarise yourself with the
`Python documentation on strings <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html>`_.


Regular expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Regular expressions can be defined as a series of characters that define a
search pattern.

Regular expressions can be very powerful. However, they can be
difficult to build up. Often it is a process of trial and error. This means
that once they have been created, and the trial and error process has been
forgotten, it can be extremely difficult to understand what the regular
expression does and why it is constructed the way it is.

.. warning:: Use regular expression as a last resort. A good rule of thumb is
             to always try to use string operations to implement the
             desired functionality and only switch to regular expressions when
             the code implemented using these operations becomes more
             difficult to understand than the equivalent regular expression.

To use regular expressions in Python we need to import the :mod:`re` module.
The :mod:`re` module is part of Python's standard library. Importing modules
in Python is achieved using the ``import`` keyword.

.. sidebar:: What is a standard library?

             In computing a standard library refers to a set of functionality
             that comes built-in with the core programming language.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import re

Let us store a FASTA description line in a variable.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> fasta_desc = ">sp|Q6GZX4|001R_FRG3G"

Now, let us search for the UniProt identifer ``Q6GZX4`` within the line.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> re.search(r"Q6GZX4", fasta_desc)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...>

There are two things to note here:

1. We use a raw string to represent our regular expression, i.e. the string prefixed with an ``r``
2. The regular expression ``search()`` method returns a match object (or None if no match is found)

.. sidebar:: What is a "raw string"?

    In Python "raw" strings differ from regular strings in that the bashslash
    ``\`` character is interpreted literally. For example the regular string
    equivalent of ``r"\n"`` would be ``"\\n"`` where the first backslash is used
    to escape the effect of the second (remember that ``\n`` represents a
    newline).

    Raw strings were introduced in Python to make it easier to create regular
    expressions that rely heavily on the use of literal backslashes.

The index of the first matched character can be accessed using the match
object's ``start()`` method.  The match object also has an ``end()`` method
that returns the index of the last character + 1.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> match = re.search(r"Q6GZX4", fasta_desc)
    >>> if match:
    ...     print(fasta_desc[match.start():match.end()])
    ...
    Q6GZX4

In the above we make use of the fact that Python strings support slicing.
Slicing is a means to access a subsection of a sequence.  The ``[start:end]``
syntax is inclusive for the start index and exclusive for the end index.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> "012345"[2:4]
    '23'

To see the merit of regular expressions we need to create one that matches more
than one thing.  For example a regular expression that could match all the
patterns ``id0``, ``id1``, ..., ``id9``.

Now suppose that we had a list containing FASTA description lines with these
types of identifiers.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> fasta_desc_list = [">id0 match this",
    ...                    ">id9 and this",
    ...                    ">id100 but not this (initially)",
    ...                    "AATCG"]
    ...

Note that the list above also contains a sequence line that we
never want to match.

Let us loop over the items in this list and print out the lines that match our
identifier regular expression.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for line in fasta_desc_list:
    ...     if re.search(r">id[0-9]\s", line):
    ...         print(line)
    ...
    >id0 match this
    >id9 and this

There are two noteworthy aspects of the regular
expression. Firstly, the ``[0-9]`` syntax means match any digit.
Secondly, the ``\s`` regular
expression meta character means match any white space character. 

.. sidebar:: The ``[0-9]`` syntax works in Bash too!

             For example to list the files ``photo_0.png``, ``photo_1.png``,
             ..., ``photo_9.png`` you could use the command.

             .. code-block:: none

                $ ls photo_[0-9].png

If one wanted to create a regular expression to match an identifier with an
arbitrary number of digits one can make use of the ``*`` meta character, which
causes the regular expression to match the preceding expression 0 or more times.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for line in fasta_desc_list:
    ...     if re.search(r">id[0-9]*\s", line):
    ...         print(line)
    ...
    >id0 match this
    >id9 and this
    >id100 but not this (initially)

It is possible to extract specific pieces of information from a line using
regular expressions. This uses a concept known as "groups", which are indicated
using parenthesis. Let us try to extract the UniProt identifier from a FASTA
description line.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(fasta_desc)
    >sp|Q6GZX4|001R_FRG3G
    >>> match = re.search(r">sp\|([A-Z,0-9]*)\|", fasta_desc)

.. warning:: Note how horrible and incomprehensible the regular expression is.

It took me a couple of attempts to get this regular expression right as I
forgot that ``|`` is a regular expression meta character that needs to be
escaped using a backslash ``\``.

The regular expression representing the UniProt idendifier ``[A-Z,0-9]*`` means
match capital letters (``A-Z``) and digits (``0-9``) zero or more times (``*``).
The UniProt regular expression is enclosed in parenthesis. The parenthesis
denote that the UniProt identifier is a group that we would like access to. In
other words, the purpose of a group is to give the user access to a section of
interest within the regular expression.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> match.groups()
    ('Q6GZX4',)
    >>> match.group(0)  # Everything matched by the regular expression.
    '>sp|Q6GZX4|'
    >>> match.group(1)

.. note:: There is a difference between the ``groups()`` and the ``group()``
          methods. The former returns a tuple containing all the groups
          defined in the regular expression. The latter takes an integer as
          input and returns a specific group. However, confusingly ``group(0)``
          returns everything matched by the regular expression and ``group(1)``
          returns the first group making the ``group()`` method appear as if
          it used a one-based indexing scheme.

Finally Let us have a look at a common pitfall when using regular expressions
in Python: the difference between the methods search() and match().

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(re.search(r"cat", "my cat has a hat"))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...>
    >>> print(re.match(r"cat", "my cat has a hat"))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    None

Basically ``match()`` only looks for a match at the beginning of the string to
be searched. For more information see the
`search() vs match() <https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#search-vs-match>`_
section in the Python documentation.

There is a lot more to regular expressions in particular all the meta
characters. For more information have a look at the
`regular expressions operations <https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html>`_
section in the Python documentation.



Extracting the organism name
----------------------------

Armed with our new found knowledge of string processing let's create a function
for extracting the organism name from a SwissProt FASTA description line. In
other words given the lines:

.. code-block:: none

    >sp|P01090|2SS2_BRANA Napin-2 OS=Brassica napus PE=2 SV=2
    >sp|Q15942|ZYX_HUMAN Zyxin OS=Homo sapiens GN=ZYX PE=1 SV=1
    >sp|Q6QGT3|A1_BPT5 A1 protein OS=Escherichia phage T5 GN=A1 PE=2 SV=1

We would like to extract the strings:

.. code-block:: none

    Brassica napus
    Homo sapiens
    Escherichia phage T5

There are three things which are worth noting:

1. The organism name string is always preceeded by the key ``OS`` (Organism Name)
2. The organism name string can contain more than two words
3. The two letter key after the organism name string can vary, in the case
   above we see both ``PS`` (Protein Existence) and ``GE`` (Gene Name)

For more information about the UniProt FASTA description line go to `UniProt's
FASTA header <http://www.uniprot.org/help/fasta-headers>`_ page.

The three FASTA description lines examined above provide an excellent basis for
creating a test for the function that we want. Add the lines below
to your ``fasta_utils.py`` file.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 15
    :emphasize-lines: 1-9

    def test_extract_organism_name():
        """Test the extract_organism_name() function."""
        print("Testing the extract_organism_name() function...")
        lines = [">sp|P01090|2SS2_BRANA Napin-2 OS=Brassica napus PE=2 SV=2",
            ">sp|Q15942|ZYX_HUMAN Zyxin OS=Homo sapiens GN=ZYX PE=1 SV=1",
            ">sp|Q6QGT3|A1_BPT5 A1 protein OS=Escherichia phage T5 GN=A1 PE=2 SV=1"]
        organism_names = ["Brassica napus", "Homo sapiens", "Escherichia phage T5"]
        for line, organism_name in zip(lines, organism_names):
            assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name

    test_is_description_line()

In the above we make use of pythons built-in :func:`zip` function. This function takes two
lists as inputs and returns a list with paired values from the input lists.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3])
    [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

Let's make sure that the tests fail.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...

What, no error message, what is going on? Ah, we added the test, but forgot to
add a line to call it. Let's rectify that.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 25
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    test_is_description_line()
    test_extract_organism_name()

Let's try again.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 26, in <module>
        test_extract_organism_name()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 23, in test_extract_organism_name
        assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name
    NameError: global name 'extract_organism_name' is not defined

Success! We now have a failing test informing us that we need to create the
:func:`extract_organism_name` function. Let's do that.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 15
    :emphasize-lines: 1,2

    def extract_organism_name(line):
        """Return the organism name from a FASTA description line."""

Let's find out where this minimal implementation gets us.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 29, in <module>
        test_extract_organism_name()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 26, in test_extract_organism_name
        assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name
    AssertionError

The test fails as expected. However, since we are looping over many input
lines it would be good to get an idea of which test failed. We can achieve this
by making use of the fact that we can provide a custom message to be passed to
the ``AssertionError``. Let us pass it the input line. Note the addition of the
trailing ``, line`` in line 26.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 25
    :emphasize-lines: 2

        for line, organism_name in zip(lines, organism_names):
            assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name, line


Let's see what we get now.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 29, in <module>
        test_extract_organism_name()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 26, in test_extract_organism_name
        assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name, line
    AssertionError: >sp|P01090|2SS2_BRANA Napin-2 OS=Brassica napus PE=2 SV=2

Much better! Let us try to implement a basic regular expression to make this
pass. First of all we need to make sure we import the :mod:`re`
module.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    """Module containing utility functions for working with FASTA files."""

    import re

Then we can implement a regular expression to try to extract the organism name.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 17
    :emphasize-lines: 1-4

    def extract_organism_name(line):
        """Return the organism name from a FASTA description line."""
        match = re.search(r"OS=(.*) PE=", line)
        return match.group(1)

Remember the ``.*`` means match any character zero or more times and the
surrounding parenthesis creates a group.

Let us see what happens now.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 34, in <module>
        test_extract_organism_name()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 31, in test_extract_organism_name
        assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name, line
    AssertionError: >sp|Q15942|ZYX_HUMAN Zyxin OS=Homo sapiens GN=ZYX PE=1 SV=1

Progress! We are now seeing a different error message. The issue is that the key after
the regular expression is ``GN`` rather than ``PE``. Let us try to rectify that.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 17
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    def extract_organism_name(line):
        """Return the organsim name from a FASTA description line."""
        match = re.search(r"OS=(.*) [A-Z]{2}=", line)
        return match.group(1)

The regular expression now states that instead of ``PE`` it wants any capital
letter ``[A-Z]`` repeated twice ``{2}``. Let's find out if this fixes the issue.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 33, in <module>
        test_extract_organism_name()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 30, in test_extract_organism_name
        assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name, line
    AssertionError: >sp|P01090|2SS2_BRANA Napin-2 OS=Brassica napus PE=2 SV=2

What, back at square one again? As mentioned previously, regular expressions can be painful
and should only be used as a last resort. This also exemplifies why it is
important to have tests. Sometimes you think you make an innocuous change, but instead things
just fall apart.

At this stage the error message is not very useful, let us change it to print
out the value returned by the function instead.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 29
    :emphasize-lines: 2

        for line, organism_name in zip(lines, organism_names):
            assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name, extract_organism_name(line)

Now, let's see what is going on.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 33, in <module>
        test_extract_organism_name()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 30, in test_extract_organism_name
        assert extract_organism_name(line) == organism_name, extract_organism_name(line)
    AssertionError: Brassica napus PE=2

Our regular expression is basically matching too much. The reason for this is that the
``*`` meta character acts in a "greedy" fashion matching as much as possible,
see :numref:`greedy_vs_non-greedy_regular_expression`. In this case
the ``PE=2`` is included in the match group as ``[A-Z]{2}`` is matched by the ``SV=`` key
at the end of the line. The fix is to make the ``*`` meta character act in a "non-greedy"
fashion. This is achieved by adding a ``?`` suffix to it.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 17
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    def extract_organism_name(line):
        """Return the organism name from a FASTA description line."""
        match = re.search(r"OS=(.*?) [A-Z]{2}=", line)
        return match.group(1)

Let's find out what happens now.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...

All the tests pass! Well done, time for another cup of tea.

.. _greedy_vs_non-greedy_regular_expression:
.. figure:: images/greedy-regex.png
   :alt: Greedy vs non-greedy regular expression.

   Figure illustrating the difference between a greedy and a non-greedy regular
   expression. The ``*`` meta-character causes the previous regular expression,
   in this case the any character (``.``), to be matched zero or more times.
   This is done in a greedy fashion, i.e. trying to match as much text as
   possible.  To make that part of the regular expression match as little text
   as possible, i.e. to work in a non-greedy fashion, we use the meta-character
   ``*?``.



Only running tests when the module is called directly
-----------------------------------------------------

In Python, modules provide a means to group related functionality together. For
example we have already looked at and made use of the :mod:`re` module, which
groups functionality for working with regular expressions.

In Python any file with a ``.py`` extension is a module. This means that the
file that we have been creating, ``fasta_utils.py``, is a module.

To make use of the functionality within a module one needs to ``import`` it.
Let's try this out in an interactive session

.. code-block:: none

    $ python

Now we can import the module.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import fasta_utils  # doctest: +SKIP
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...

Note that the tests run just like when we call the ``fasta_utils.py``
script directly. This is an undesired side effect of the current
implementation. It would be better if the tests were not run when the module
is imported.

To improve the behaviour of the :mod:`fasta_utils` module we will make use of a
special Python attribute called ``__name__``, which provides a string representation
of :term:`scope`. When commands are run from a script or the interactive prompt the
name attribute is set to ``__main__``. When a module is imported the ``__name__``
attribute is set to the name of the module.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(__name__)
    __main__
    >>> print(fasta_utils.__name__)  # doctest: +SKIP
    fasta_utils

Using this information we can update the ``fasta_utils.py`` file with
the changes highlighted below.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 32
    :emphasize-lines: 1-3

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        test_is_description_line()
        test_extract_organism_name()

Let us make sure that the tests still run if we run the script directly.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...

Now we can reload the module in the interactive prompt we were working in
earlier to make sure that the tests no longer get executed.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> reload(fasta_utils)  # doctest: +SKIP
    <module 'fasta_utils' from 'fasta_utils.py'>

The test suite is no longer being called upon loading the module and no lines
logging the progress of the testing suite is being printed to the terminal.

Note that simply calling the ``import fasta_utils`` command again will not
actually detect the changes that we made to the ``fasta_utils.py`` file,
which is why we make use of Python's built-in :func:`reload` function. Alternatively,
one could have exited the Python shell, using Ctrl-D or the :func:`exit` function,
and then started a new interactive Python session and imported the :mod:`fasta_utils`
module again.


Counting the number of unique organisms
---------------------------------------

We can now use the :mod:`fasta_utils` module to start answering some of the
biological questions that we posed at the beginning of this chapter. For now
let us do this using an interactive Python shell.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python
    Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.39)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

Now we will start by importing the modules that we want to use. In this case
:mod:`fasta_utils` for processing the data and :mod:`gzip` for opening and
reading in the data from the ``uniprot_sprot.2015-11-26.fasta.gz`` file.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import fasta_utils
    >>> import gzip

Now we create a list for storing all the FASTA description lines.

    >>> fasta_desc_lines = []

We can then open the file using the :func:`gzip.open` function. Note that this
returns a file handle.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> file_handle = gzip.open("../data/uniprot_sprot.2015-11-26.fasta.gz")

Using a ``for`` loop we can iterate over all the lines in the input file.

    >>> for line in file_handle:
    ...     if fasta_utils.is_description_line(line):
    ...          fasta_desc_lines.append(line)
    ...

When we are finished with the input file we must remember to close it.

    >>> file_handle.close()

Let's check that the number of FASTA description lines using the built-in
:func:`len` function. This function returns the number of items
in the list, i.e. the length of the list.

    >>> len(fasta_desc_lines)
    549832

Okay now it is time to find the number of unique organisms. For this we will make
use of a data structure called ``set``. In Python sets are used to compare
collections of unique elements. This means that sets are ideally suited for
operations that you may associate with Venn diagrams.

However, in this instance we simply use the ``set`` data structure to ensure
that we only get one unique representative of each organism. In other words
even if one calls the :func:`set.add` function several times with the same item
the item will only occur once in the set.

    >>> organisms = set()
    >>> for line in fasta_desc_lines:
    ...     s = fasta_utils.extract_organism_name(line)
    ...     organisms.add(s)
    ...
    >>> len(organisms)
    13251

Great, now we know that there are 13,251 unique organisms represented in the
FASTA file.


Finding the number of variants per species and the number of proteins per variant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose we had a FASTA file containing only four entries with the description
lines below.

.. code-block:: none

    >sp|P12334|AZUR1_METJ Azurin iso-1 OS=Methylomonas sp. (strain J) PE=1 SV=2
    >sp|P12335|AZUR2_METJ Azurin iso-2 OS=Methylomonas sp. (strain J) PE=1 SV=1
    >sp|P23827|ECOT_ECOLI Ecotin OS=Escherichia coli (strain K12) GN=eco PE=1 SV=1
    >sp|B6I1A7|ECOT_ECOSE Ecotin OS=Escherichia coli (strain SE11) GN=eco PE=3 SV=1

The analysis in the previous section would have identified these as three
separate entities.

.. code-block:: none

    Methylomonas sp. (strain J)
    Escherichia coli (strain K12)
    Escherichia coli (strain SE11)

Now, suppose that we wanted to find out how many variants there were of each
species. In the example above there would be be one variant of ``Methylomonas
sp.`` and two variants of ``Escherichia coli``. Furthermore, suppose that we
also wanted to find out how many proteins were associated with each variant.

We could achieve this by creating a nested data structure using Python's built
in dictionary type. At the top level we should have a dictionary
whose keys were the species, e.g. ``Escherichia coli``. The values in the top
level dictionary should themselves be dictionaries. The keys of the nested dictionaries
should be the full organism name, e.g. ``Escherichia coli (strain K12)``. The values
in the nested dictionary should be an integer representing the number of proteins found
for that organism. Below is a YAML representation of the data structure that should be
created from the four entries above.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    Methylomonas sp.:
      Methylomonas sp. (strain J): 2
    Escherichia coli:
      Escherichia coli (strain K12): 1
      Escherichia coli (strain SE11): 1

So what type of functionality would we need to achieve this? First of all we need a
function that given an organism name returns the associated species. In other words
something that converts ``Escherichia coli (strain K12)`` to ``Escherichia coli``.
Secondly, we need a function that given a list of organism names returns the data
structure described above.

Let us start by creating a test for converting the organism name into a species.
Add the test below to ``fasta_utils.py``.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 32
    :emphasize-lines: 1-4, 9

    def test_organism_name2species():
        print("Testing the organism_name2species() function...")
        assert organism_name2species("Methylomonas sp. (strain J)") == "Methylomonas sp."
        assert organism_name2species("Homo sapiens") == "Homo sapiens"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        test_is_description_line()
        test_extract_organism_name()
        test_organism_name2species()

Let's find out what error this gives us.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Testing the organism_name2species() function...

        assert organism_name2species("Methylomonas sp. (strain J)") == "Methylomonas sp."
    NameError: global name 'organism_name2species' is not defined

The error message is telling us that we need to define the
:func:`organism_name2species` function. Add the lines below to define it.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 32
    :emphasize-lines: 1-2

    def organism_name2species(organism_name):
        """Return the species from the FASTA organism name."""

Now we get a new error message when we run the tests.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Testing the organism_name2species() function...

      File "fasta_utils.py", line 37, in test_organism_name2species
        assert organism_name2species("Methylomonas sp. (strain J)") == "Methylomonas sp."
    AssertionError

Great, let us add some logic to the function.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 32
    :emphasize-lines: 3-4

    def organism_name2species(organism_name):
        """Return the species from the FASTA organism name."""
        words = organism_name.split()
        return words[0] + " " + words[1]

Above, we split the organism name based on whitespace separators and return the
first two words joined by a space character.

.. note:: In Python, and many other scripting languages, strings can be concatenated using the ``+`` operator.

         .. code-block:: python

                >>> "hello" + " " + "world"
                'hello world'

Time to test the code again.

This should all be getting familiar now. Time to run the tests.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Testing the organism_name2species() function...
    Testing summarise_species_protein_data() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        summary = summarise_species_protein_data(fasta_desc_lines)
    NameError: global name 'summarise_species_protein_data' is not defined

Again we start by defining the function.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 42
    :emphasize-lines: 1-2

    def summarise_species_protein_data(fasta_desc_lines):
        """Return data structure summarising the organism and protein data."""

And then we run the tests again.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Testing the organism_name2species() function...
    Testing summarise_species_protein_data() function...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 74, in <module>
        test_summarise_species_protein_data()
      File "fasta_utils.py", line 57, in test_summarise_species_protein_data
        assert len(summary) == 2
    TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()

Time to add an implementation.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 42
    :emphasize-lines: 3-10

    def summarise_species_protein_data(fasta_desc_lines):
        """Return data structure summarising the organism and protein data."""
        summary = dict()
        for line in fasta_desc_lines:
            variant_name = extract_organism_name(line)
            species_name = organism_name2species(variant_name)
            variant_dict = summary.get(species_name, dict())
            variant_dict[variant_name] = variant_dict.get(variant_name, 0) + 1
            summary[species_name] = variant_dict
        return summary

In the above we make use of the dictionary's built-in ``get()`` method, which
returns the value associated with the key provided as the first argument. If the
key does not yet exist in the dictionary it returns the second argument, the
default value.

On line 48 we try to access a ``variant_dict`` dictionary from within the ``summary``
dictionary, we are in other words working with a nested data structure. If there
is no entry associated with the ``species_name`` the ``get()`` method will return
an empty dictionary (``dict()``).

On line 49 we keep count of the number of times a variant of a species, as defined
by the full organism name, has been observed. In this instance we
use the ``get()`` method to get the number of times the variant has been observed
previously and then we add 1 to it. If the variant has never been observed previously
it will not be in the dictionary and the ``variant_dict.get(variant_name, 0)`` method
call will return 0 (the default value specified).

Line 50 updates the top level dictionary by adding the
``variant_dict`` dictionary to the ``summary`` dictionary.

Let's see if it the implementation works as expected.

.. code-block:: none

    $ python fasta_utils.py
    Testing the is_description_line() function...
    Testing the extract_organism_name() function...
    Testing the organism_name2species() function...
    Testing summarise_species_protein_data() function...

Hurray!

Finally, let us write a separate script to convert an input FASTA file into a
YAML summary file. Create the file ``fasta2yaml_summary.py`` and add the
code below to it.

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import sys
    import yaml

    import fasta_utils

    fasta_desc_lines = list()

    with sys.stdin as fh:
        for line in fh:
            if fasta_utils.is_description_line(line):
                fasta_desc_lines.append(line)

    summary = fasta_utils.summarise_species_protein_data(fasta_desc_lines)
    yaml_text = yaml.dump(summary, explicit_start=True, default_flow_style=False)

    with sys.stdout as fh:
        fh.write(yaml_text)

In the code above we make use of the yaml module to convert our data structure
to the YAML file format. The PyYAML package is not part of the Python's
standard library, but it is easily installed using ``pip`` (for more detailed
instructions see :ref:`installing_python_packages`).

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo pip install pyyaml

The script also makes use of ``sys.stdin`` and ``sys.stdout`` to read from
the :term:`standard input stream` and write to the :term:`standard output
stream`, respectively. This means that we can :term:`pipe` in the content to
our script and pipe output from our script.
For example to examine the YAML
output using the ``less`` pager one could use the command below.

.. code-block:: none

    $ gunzip -c data/uniprot_sprot.2015-11-26.fasta.gz | python fasta2yaml_summary.py | less

This immediately reveals that there are organisms in the SwissProt FASTA file
that have few protein associated with them.

.. note:: 

    Remember the benefits of using pipes was described in :ref:`creating_workflows_using_pipes`.

          script.

Great work!

Key concepts
------------

- Think about the problem at hand before you start coding
- Break down large tasks into smaller more manageable tasks, repeat until the
  tasks seem trivial
- Test-driven development is a software development practise that can help
  break tasks into manageable chunks that can be tested
- Many aspects of biological data processing boil down to string manipulations
- Regular expressions are a powerful tool for performing string manipulations,
  but use with caution as they can result in confusion
- Python has many built-in packages for performing complex tasks, in this chapter
  we used the :mod:`re` package for working with regular expressions
- There are also many third party Python packages that can be installed, in
  this chapter we made use of the :mod:`yaml` package for writing out a data
  structure as a YAML file
- If in doubt, turn to the abundance of resources for Python online including
  manuals, tutorials and help forums
