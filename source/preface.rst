Who should read this booklet
----------------------------

**Biologists that need to use the command line.**
If you want to learn how to use the command line to install and run
software this book is for you. The command line is used throughout
the book and you will quickly gain familiarity with the most important
commands. You will also learn how to install software and how to
work on remote machines. The latter will be important if you want to
run bioinformatics software on your institutes high performance cluster.

**Biologists that want to create their own data analysis scripts.**
If you want to learn how to write your own data analysis scripts
this book is also for you. The book starts off by explaining fundamental
computing concepts, teaching you how to think like a computer.
You will then learn how to use Python by creating a script to analyse
the GC-content of a bacterial genome. There is also a chapter on
data visualisation that teaches you how to work with R. Furthermore,
programming best practises are highlighted and explained throughout the
book.

**Biologists that want to ensure their data analysis is reproducible.**
If you want to ensure that your data analysis is reproducible this book
is also for you. Early on you will learn how to use version control to
track changes to your projects. Furthermore, the concept of using
automation to ensure reproducibility is explored in detail.


**No prior knowledge required.**
Important concepts and jargon are explained as they are introduced.  No
prior knowledge is required. Just a willingness to learn, experiment
and have fun geeking out.
